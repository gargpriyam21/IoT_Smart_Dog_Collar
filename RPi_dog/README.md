# IoT Final Project Group11

This repository is created for the sole purpose of uploading codes related to the Final Project for the course CSC 591 - 022 Internet of Things: Architectures, Applications, and Implementation Spring 2022 of North Carolina State University.

## Environment
- Python 3.7.3

## Requirements
### Software
- Python3 3.7.3
- paho-mqtt v1.6.1
- numpy v1.19.5
- mosquitto 
- wiotp-sdk
- requests
- RPi.GPIO
- MATLAB

```
pip install requirements.txt
```

### Hardware
- x1 Raspberry Pi 3b
- x1 MPU6050 Accelerometer + gyro

To setup the hardware for both Pis, connect the following raspberry pi GPIO pins to the corresponding MPU pins.

GPIO 2 to SDA, <br />
GPIO 3 to SCL, <br />
5V to VCC, <br />
GND to GND <br />


## Procedure
Initially update the `BROKER` and `PORT`in the code file (*constants.py*) to the IP_ADDRESS and PORT of device where the Broker is currently running. If the broker is on the same device update the value of BROKER_IP_ADDRESS to **'localhost'** and PORT to **'1883'**

- To run from file location: 

```
python3 dogPub.py
```
